Python/Cython modules

Ceygen: basic BLAS routines for memoryviews. Allows some linear algebra in pure Cython (no Numpy)
Cython: hybrid of C and Python
yep: complex profiling of code (for determining which parts of the code are speed bottlenecks)
matplotlib: plotting routines
time: for getting/converting system time

C modules

GSL: random number generators, probability densities, BLAS routines, and lots more. Way faster than pure Python
Math: C math library; stuff like square root, power, absolute value, etc. Way faster than pure Python
